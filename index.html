    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am a microbiologist with a strong research focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR),
        natural products, and infectious diseases. My academic training and research experience
        center on identifying biologically active microbial metabolites and understanding
        host–pathogen interactions that drive disease and treatment outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold a B.Sc. in Microbiology from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, where I graduated
        with distinction and completed an undergraduate thesis on the antimicrobial potential
        and viability of endophytic fungi. I am currently engaged in collaborative research
        involving fungal secondary metabolites, biosynthetic pathway reactivation, and
        antimicrobial bioactivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am seeking MSc and PhD training opportunities that combine experimental microbiology
        with translational approaches to drug discovery, delivery, and resistance mitigation.

    <h2>Research Experience</h2>

    <p>
        My research experience spans laboratory-based microbiology, literature-driven discovery,
        and collaborative manuscript development. I have worked extensively with endophytic
        fungi, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and metabolite extraction, while also
        contributing to computational and <em>in silico</em> analyses in drug discovery projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have collaborated across microbiology and chemistry research teams on projects focused
        on fungal bioactivity, epigenetic modulation of secondary metabolite production, and the
        identification of candidate compounds targeting resistant bacterial pathogens.
    </p>

    <p>
        In parallel, I actively engage in scientific writing and synthesis, contributing to
        peer-reviewed publications and review articles addressing antimicrobial resistance,
        fungal metabolites, and infectious disease challenges.
